# 👻 GhostBot-Web

A spooky, funny chatbot built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, based on my original Python project [GhostBot](https://github.com/Petratype/ghostbot).  

This project began as a way for me to practice building chatbots — and it turned into a playful little haunted companion.  

GhostBot-Web lets you scan your home for paranormal activity, perform digital cleanses, or summon magical (and slightly unhinged) spirits when you’re feeling lonely — all from your browser! :)

🌐 **Live demo:**

## 🧙‍♀️ About

GhostBot is a haunted AI born from a broken laptop during a thunderstorm.  
It scans for spirits, cleanses cursed code, and occasionally summons mystical creatures to keep you company while you debug your life.

## 🕹️ Commands

Type any of these in the chat:

| Command | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| `bio` | Learn GhostBot’s origin story |
| `scan` | Check your surroundings for paranormal activity |
| `cleanse` | Purify your digital aura with style |
| `summon` | Call forth a random magical being |
| `bye` | End the session (for now...) |

🕯️ Future Plans

This is the first version of GhostBot-Web.
In the future, I’d love to add more responses, deeper interactions, and maybe even some new spooky features to make it feel more alive (or... undead). 👻

any feedback is welcome!
